<p class="ph2 f3 f2-ns lh-copy measure center tl tl-m tc-ns"><strong>Storefront</strong> was intended to be a graphical interface for shopkeepers, e-commerce managers, marketing managers and designers to add new features, modify the structure and customize the appearance of their stores without necessarily having to deal with codes and technical details. They could still visually take advantage of a new platform paradigm, where stores would run extensions/apps created by the VTEX partner ecosystem. It was necessary to design both the user experience for the manager profile and for the more technical developer profile—this was the initial focus of product creation, as it would also take advantage of the code tool behind the <strong>Storefront: Render</strong>.</p>

      It was not news that the project had challenges and high complexity. There were several months of discarded solutions, team reconfiguration, technological changes and many hours of meetings to try to understand the fact that we were unable to get the project into the testing and use phase. It almost became a meme in the company, so much did people want to help and see it released.</p>

        This was definitely not an obvious project and was often confused with the new platform as a whole. Even when it came to discussing the product, we were confused by the terms used between teams and leaders. That's when we realized that one of the main issues was <strong>defining the problem</strong> and <strong>aligning language</strong> for the product team, as well as for the entire VTEX.

      <ul class="black-50 measure center center-m mh0-ns lh-copy ma0 mt4 mt4-m mt3-ns">
        <li>Defining the problem solidly and clearly before thinking about the solution</li>
        <li>Align speech and vocabulary of technical terms</li>
        <li>Flexibly give autonomy to the most lay user profile of the platform</li>
        <li>Also meet the technical developer profile</li>
        <li>Overcoming expectation and regaining confidence in the face of user frustration with known issues with the old version in use</li>
        <li>Enable the creation of different versions of store settings for real-time preview and future A/B Testing feature</li>

  <h3 class="ph2 f2 f1-ns fw2 mv0 pt4 pt5-ns pb3 black-40 tc-ns">Definition and Vocabulary</h3>
  <div class="cf ph2-ns">
    <div class="fl w-100 w-100-m w-60-ns ph2 ph2-m ph0-ns">
      <p class="f4 f3-ns lh-copy black-50 measure center center-m mh0-ns mt0">To start putting order in the house, we use the <strong>Working Backwards</strong> technique deliveryng a Internal Press-Release. It consists of writing a text in press release format before even starting to think about the solution, using simple language and imagining that the product was being launched that day. It's like working backwards to drive the definition of a solid product vision.</p>
      <p class="f4 f3-ns lh-copy black-50 measure center center-m mh0-ns mt0">With the help of a <strong>6-question</strong> framework, I fired off a Slack form for direct stakeholders and compiled the responses into a draft release. Then the Storefront team revised and iterated on the text, so we had an overview of the product we were creating. Furthermore, in order to speak the same language and hammer out concepts that were still open, we created a collaborative vocabulary based on the book <strong>How to make sense of any mess</strong>.</p>

          <li class="lh-copy pv2 ba bl-0 bt-0 br-0 b--dotted b--black-20">When can it be used and when will it be available?</li>
          <li class="lh-copy pv2 ba bl-0 bt-0 br-0 b--dotted b--black-20">Why is the product notable and why is it relevant to your audience?</li>

    <p class="f4 f3-ns measure center lh-copy black-50 mt0">Mapping the user's journey was essential for us to plan what kind of interaction and solutions we would deliver at each <strong>point of contact</strong> between the product and the user. At this point, we decided to initially focus on the journey of the technical profile: the Developer, as they would naturally have more points of contact as they are the tool's advanced user profile.</p>

      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure center center-m mh0-ns lh-copy black-50">With the profile defined, we set out to draft and explore the concepts of the resources that the product would offer. There were hours of whiteboard, paper, pen and scissors with grids, placeholds and paper components.</p>

    <div class="fl w-100 w-100-m w-50-ns ph2 ph2-m ph4-ns">
      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure center center-m mh0-ns lh-copy black-50 mt0-ns">We came to the conclusion that the only way to make the best store and app development tool for the platform would be to put yourself in the shoes of a VTEX developer, having a real store to look after. That's when we asked for the help of one of our colleagues, Afonso, who already owned a VTEX store and agreed to be (so to speak...) our guinea pig. We designed a new version of your <strong>Pilates Lovers</strong> store layout from scratch, already using the new IO structure with <strong>Render</strong> and <strong>Storefront</strong>.</p>

  <div class="cf ph4-ns pv4-ns">
    <div class="fl w-100 w-100-m w-50-ns ph2 ph2-m ph4-ns">
      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure center center-m mh0-ns lh-copy black-50 mt0-ns">We technically refined the store keeping in mind the work of a platform partner agency developer (who usually worked as a team), adding the Styleguide concept to define store theme variables such as <strong>colors</strong> and <strong>typography</strong>. This is based on the Tachyons Atomic CSS framework—ideal for the highly scalable React technology used in the Frontend and Backend of the system. The store also had a responsive and flexible grid structure to receive the most diverse types of e-commerce components.</p>
      <p class="f4 f3-ns measure center center-m mh0-ns lh-copy black-50">
        On average, every 3 weeks we personally did some hands on with guest developers from the VTEX ecosystem, collecting feedback and finding blind spots.</p>

  <div class="w-100 w-100-m w-50-ns center ph2 ph2-m ph4-ns">
    <p class="f4 f3-ns measure center lh-copy black-50 mt3">The next big step was to explore what were considered the two basic concepts of the system: <strong>Placeholder</strong> and <strong>Components</strong>. The first was a developer-defined area of the store for managers to manipulate its settings or add miscellaneous components like banners, shelves, and menus. This would allow developers to create and offer apps with customizable components for all platform customers, through the <a href="../vtex-io-en/" class="link hot-pink hover-black underline-hover">Extension Store</a>.</p>

  <p class="f4 f3-ns measure center ph2 ph2-m ph4-ns lh-copy black-50 mt0">Due to the proximity of the annual VTEX launches event for partners at the time, the project was paused so that the team could focus energies on creating the <a href="../vtex-io-en/" class="link hot-pink hover-black underline-hover">new graphical interface for IO and Extension Store</a>, a project in which I also participated as a designer. The next steps would be:</p>

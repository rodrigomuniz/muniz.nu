<p class="ph2 f3 f2-ns lh-copy measure center tl tl-m tc-ns">Called <strong>VTEX IO</strong>, the new version of the e-commerce platform in 2017 was getting a complete redesign and a new paradigm, where online stores would run extensions/apps created by the ecosystem of VTEX partners. This aroused a great concern with complexity, which already reached a good part of the old version of the product. One of them was in the way of navigating through the modules.</p>

<h3 class="ph2 f2 f1-ns fw2 mv0 pt4 pt5-ns pb3 black-40 tc-ns">The old navigation</h3>
<div class="cf ph2-ns">

    <p class="measure center lh-copy black-50 mv1 mh0">
      Despite looking quite simple and flexible, the old version of the navigation followed a logic based on the names used internally by VTEX to baptize its modules. The <strong>mental model was wrong</strong>, which meant that new users had to learn what each module did before being able to use them—this greatly restricted the platform's exploitability and created a <strong>dependency on documentation</strong>.</p>
    <p class="measure center lh-copy black-50 mv1 mh0">Another problem is that there was no sub-navigation solution, that is, a quick way to go directly to a subsection of each module. In practice, <strong>the navigation was not straightforward</strong>.

    <p class="black-50 measure center center-m mh0-ns lh-copy mt3">Além de substituir a antiga, esta nova navegação precisava também:</p>
    <ul class="black-50 measure center center-m mh0-ns lh-copy ma0">
      <li>Ser <em>cross-device</em> <em>mobile-first</em></li>
      <li>Servir como uma das bases visuais para o novo <em>Design System</em> da nova identidade visual da empresa</li>
      <li>Possuir uma arquitetura de organização e agrupamento de links que atendesse aos novos e antigos módulos, para a fase de migração das versões da plataforma</li>
      <li>Ter flexibilidade para receber links de apps criadas por terceiros, parceiros que futuramente iriam ter a possibilidade de inserir novos módulos no gerenciador das lojas de seus clientes</li>
      <li>Ser lançada juntamente com uma loja de extensões chamada de <em>Extension Store</em></li>

    <p class="f4 f3-ns lh-copy black-50 measure center mt0">Initially when discussing the solution, we quickly came to the conclusion that the organization and grouping of information would be the biggest challenges of the project.</p>
    <p class="measure center mh0-ns lh-copy black-50 mt0">
      Based on the incredible job of surveying all the platform links done a few weeks earlier by Bernardo Lemgruber, I started a benchmarking and facilitated some quick workshops with members of the technical support team. The objective was to arrive at a grouping logic of information that was easily understood. It was at this stage that we decided to take into account <strong>not only the VTEX context but the general e-commerce context</strong>, changing the use of module names such as OMS and PCI Gateway for a more common vocabulary such as <strong>Orders, Payments and Prices</strong>.

    <p class="f4 f3-ns measure center lh-copy black-50 mt0">In this step, we created a <strong>moodboard</strong> so we could collect <strong>benchmarks</strong> and we also worked with a spreadsheet to explore different types of grouping of all the links on the platform.</p>
    <p class="measure center center-m mh0-ns lh-copy black-50 mv1">The work I had done the previous year, categorizing articles in the platform's <strong>Help Center</strong> knowledge base, was also taken into account. However, in addition to internal references, we carried out a search for similar products in product navigation on other e-commerce platforms and in CMS in general, analyzing not only their structure but also their behavior. It was then that we started prototyping on paper and in high fidelity.</p>

  <p class="f4 f3-ns measure center lh-copy black-50 mv1 mh0 ph2 ph0-ns">As the navigation would be launched alongside a general redesign of the platform and the extension store module—Luiza Breier and I worked on the visual design and general structure of the <strong>Extension Store</strong>, taking into account that it would serve as the basis for the new <strong>Styleguide</strong> of system and would also be the initial use case for the new navigation. We dedicated a few days to a wide generation of variants of layouts and flows with the collection of feedback from the design team and stakeholders. </p>

    <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy black-50 mt0">Quick swap was the solution to several issues in the solution. Not only would it meet the "Useful" and "Direct" principles for super-fast navigation between modules, but it would also help the user find the equivalent areas in the old version's modules in the new version—during the migration period.</p>
    <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy black-50 mt0">In the video, <strong>when searching for the old "OMS" sales management module, the user would see the sales module in the new version of the platform as the result.</strong></p>

    <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy black-50 mv1 center center-m mh0-ns">As the navigation would also need to be present in the old version of the modules, we created the prototype of a version that would be a sidebar from left to right, responding to the user's click on the menu icon at the top of the old manager. On mobile, navigation would appear in full screen.</p>

  <p class="f4 f3-ns measure center lh-copy black-50 mv1 mh0 ph2 ph0-ns">On the week the Extension Store was announced at the company's annual event, <strong>VTEX Day 2017</strong>, we were able to conduct some guerrilla usability testing with partners and members of the VTEX financial team. The biggest issues encountered were related to performance and some bugs that would be fixed quickly before the public beta launch, when shopkeepers began to use and evaluate the beta version of the solution.</p>
